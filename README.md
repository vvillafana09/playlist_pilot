# PlaylistPilot

This is PlaylistPilot! 
A  web application that leverages a content-based recommendation system to provide users with song recommendations based on their Spotify playlists

## Motivation
During my Information Retrieval class, I learned about various recommendation systems, sparking my curiosity about their real-world applications. As a frequent Spotify user who enjoys curating playlists based on different genres, moods, and seasons, I've always wondered about the algorithms behind Spotify's song recommendations. To delve deeper into this, I created PlaylistPilot, a project aimed at exploring and potentially improving the song recommendations provided by Spotify.

## Usage

1. **Sign In**: Users begin by signing into PlaylistPilot using their Spotify account credentials. This ensures that the app can access their playlists and track features to generate personalized recommendations
2. **Playlist Selection**: Upon signing in, users are presented with a list of their created playlists. They can choose a playlist they wish to see new song recommendations
3. **Recommedations**: After selecting a playlist, PlaylistPilot generates a list of the top 5 songs to recommend for that specific playlist. These recommednations are based on various factors including the playlist's genre, mood, and audio features.
    * **Feature Representation:**
    Represented each song in the dataset as a vector of popularity, genre, and audio features which include: danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, temp, duration_ms, and time_signature
    * **User Profile:**
    Created a user profile based on the songs in the user's playlist. Aggreate the same features on the songs in the playlist (popularity, genre(s), and auido features) to represent the user's preferences.
    * **Similarity Calculation:**
    Used cosine similarity to calcualte the similarity between each song in the dataset and the uesr profile
